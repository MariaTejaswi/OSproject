Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator
Project Overview
This project implements an Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator that simulates various disk scheduling algorithms:

FCFS (First Come First Serve)
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
The goal of this project is to understand how different disk scheduling algorithms work and compare their efficiency in terms of seek time. The simulator takes user inputs for the initial head position and the request sequence and then executes the selected algorithm to calculate the total seek time and display the order of execution.
